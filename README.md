## Description:

This application is to create a currency exchange . A user should be able to type in an amount (in U.S. dollars) and then choose which currency it should be converted to (such as francs, marks, rupees, and so on).

- A user should be able to enter an amount (in U.S. dollars) and then specify another currency (such as the South Korean won). The user should then see the total amount they entered in converted currency. In the example above, a user might enter 10 dollars and then see that amount in South Korean won.

- Users should be able to convert U.S. currency into at least 5 other types of currency.

- If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification to the user that states what the error is. (That means the error should show up in the DOM, not in the console.)

- If the query response doesn't include that particular currency, the application should return a notification that states the currency in question doesn't exist. 

### Creating API Keys

You will need to make an account and get an API key. The "Free Plan" allows for 2000 API calls per month. That should be more than enough for this project, but avoid making excessive API calls (such as accidental infinite loops) during development.

- Visit the ExchangeRate-API site. Input your email address and click the "Get Free Key" button.
- You'll be prompted to create an account with your email, first name and a password. Agree to the terms of use and click "Get Started!"

- At this point, you'll be able to access a dashboard that includes your API key as well as your remaining API calls for the month.

### Setup Instructions

Place your token in an .env file at the top level of your directory. ( name your API key variable API_KEY in .env. Keep spelling and capitalization identical, as it considerably speeds up the grading process.)
Include .env in .gitignore.
